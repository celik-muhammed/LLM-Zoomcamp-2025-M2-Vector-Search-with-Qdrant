    "Qdrant is fully open-source, which means you can run it in multiple ways depending on your needs.  \n",

    "We're going to run a Qdrant instance in a Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the environment you created specifically for this course, we’ll install:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `qdrant-client` package. We'll be using the Python client, but Qdrant also offers official clients for JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Rust, so you can choose the best fit for your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `fastembed` package - an optimized embedding (data vectorization) solution designed specifically for Qdrant. Make sure you install version `>= 1.14.2` to use the **local inference** with Qdrant."
